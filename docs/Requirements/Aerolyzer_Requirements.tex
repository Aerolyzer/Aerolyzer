\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Purpose}
The purpose of this project, Aerolyzer (version 1.0), is to develop a mobile web application that supports the ability to understand content from user-uploaded digital outdoor images.
Our goal is to allow the general public to better monitor current aerosol content.

\subsection{Scope}
This software will be a mobile web application for use by the general public. 
This application will be designed to uniquely utilize color distribution within an uploaded mobile image to identify features necessary for analyzing aerosol content. 
The end product will be a full mobile web app that employs an open source algorithm translating how the human brain interprets images using RGB values. 
Citizens in the general public will be able to quantify color in images and use the resulting data to determine current aerosol content. 


More specifically, users will be able to upload an image of an outdoor scene taken on a mobile phone. 
The application will then give output detailing the current aerosol content of the atmosphere based on the uploaded image. 
This software will provide average citizens with near-real time monitoring of atmospheric conditions.

\subsection{Definitions, acronyms, and abbreviations}
\textbf{Aerosol: }Minute particles suspended in the atmosphere. 
When these particles are sufficiently large, we notice their presence as they scatter and absorb sunlight. 
Their scattering of sunlight can reduce visibility (haze) and redden sunrises and sunsets. [1]

\textbf{EXIF/exif: }Exchangeable image file format specifying the specs of digital/smartphone cameras. 

\textbf{MISR: }Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer satellite. [3]

More definitions, acronyms, and abbreviations will be added as needed to this requirements specification document.

\subsection{Overview}
The next section, Overall Description, of this document gives an overview of the functionality of the product. 
It describes the informal requirements and is used to establish a context for the technical requirements specification in the next section.
The third section, Specific Requirements, of this document is written primarily for the developers and describes in technical terms the details of the functionality of the product.

Both sections of the document describe the same software product in its entirety, but are intended for different audiences and thus use different language.

\section{Overall Description}
This section will give an overview of the whole application. 
The app will be explained in its context to show how it interacts within a larger system, as well as introduce basic functionality. 
It will also describe the type of stakeholders who will use the app and what functionality is available for them. 
At last, the constraints and assumptions for the system will be presented.

\subsection{Product Perspective}
Aerolyzer will be an independent and self-contained mobile web application. 
It is not designed to be a component of a larger system. 
Mobile images and associated metadata used for the color-analyzing algorithm will be from various online sources, such as Weather Underground.

As a note, Aerolyzer will be similar to other citizen science applications, though not part of those applications, by allowing user images to be used in improving the machine learning of the algorithm. 
More information about the citizen science component of the system will be added as needed to this requirements specification document.

\subsection{Product Functions}
Within the mobile application, users will be able to upload an image of an outdoor scene with the sky in view from their phone’s camera roll.
An algorithm will use the image's colors and associated metadata, combined with other meteorological data, to output current atmospheric conditions and aerosol content. Output from the color-analyzing algorithm will be displayed on the screen for the user.
 
\subsection{User Characteristics}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Users will be smartphone owners. 
	\item Users will need technical knowledge about the basic functionality of their smartphones to take photos.

	\item Users can access the application on their desktop computer or smartphone, but will need to know how to use a web browser and navigate to the Aerolyzer app for both interfaces. 

	\item Users will need to have access to mobile photos whether they are on the smartphone or desktop version of the web application.

	\item Users’ educational levels can be anywhere across the board; they do not need expertise in aerosols in order to understand output. 
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Constraints}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Although the system is a web application, uploaded images must be taken on phones in order for the algorithm to give correct output. Images from mobile phones include associated metadata that will be needed for the aerosol analyzing algorithm, and this metadata is not present on non-mobile cameras.
	\item Images uploaded to Aerolyzer cannot be “cleaned up” before being uploaded, as this could distort the color. This means no filters or other image editing tools can be used on the images. 
	\item Only direct landscape images with the sky in view can be uploaded to Aerolyzer. For example, images taken from inside a window or a picture of grass will not give accurate output about current aerosol conditions. 
\end{enumerate}
More information about constraints of the system will be added as needed to this requirements specification document.
\subsection{Assumptions and Dependencies}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item We assume users are willing to give permission for having their images accessed and processed.
	\item We assume that users have access to at least one mobile image in their photo library to be uploaded.
	\item We assume that users are connected to the Internet.
	\item We assume users have access to a web browser.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Specific Requirements}
This section will give an overview of specific requirements for the application. 
Links to external systems will be explained to show what other resources the application will use.
The app's functions in terms of individual use cases will be described in detail.

\subsection{External Interfaces}
One link to an external system will be accessing weather information from the Weather Underground database using their Weather API.  
We will need this to gather astronomy data, almanac information, and current conditions (at a minimum). 
The output from this API will be used as input by the algorithm that determines current aerosol content. [2]

Another link to an external database will be pulling outdoor images from online sources to be used in the color-analyzing algorithm’s machine learning. 
The source of these images will be from reputable repositories of images that include associated mobile camera metadata, such as Weather Underground. 
The purpose of these images will be to use them as input in order to improve the algorithm’s machine learning component.

A final link to an external interface will be the access to stored images and associated output from the color-analyzing algorithm. 
More information about image and data storage will be added as needed to this requirements specification document.

\textbf{Exception Paths: }
If the needed meteorological data is not available, the algorithm will still run and give output that does not include the meteorological data.

\subsection{Performance Requirements}
The web application will have both mobile-scaled and desktop-scaled interfaces.

The system will be able to analyze at most 500 images per day total and at most 10 images per minute total (meaning for all combined users, not each individual user).

More performance requirements will be added to this requirements specification document after further research on the color-analyzing algorithm capabilities is complete.
